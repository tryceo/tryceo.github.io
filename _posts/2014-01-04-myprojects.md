Past Broadcast:

During my free time, I created an Android application called Past Broadcast. This application can view the past videos of channels on the popular streaming platforms. Twitch.tv and Azubu.tv. Currently, I’m in the process of publishing the app on the Google Play Store. To develop this application, I had to thoroughly learn about the Java programming language and the Android SDK.

Flappy Java:

Whenever I play video games, I always think about what goes on behind on the scenes. What methods are called when my character attacks? What variables does an NPC contain? Flappy Java is my first venture into video game development. It is a remake of the popular game Flappy Bird. To develop this game, I used a game-development application framework called libGDX. This allows the game to be playable on multiple platforms without rewriting code.

Natural Number Calculator:

natural number

I worked on many projects in my “Softwares I” course. One of the most challenging projects was the implementation of a GUI calculator. This calculator can do elementary arithmetic operations, such as plus and minus, as well as advanced arithmetic operations, like power and root. The calculator can handle natural numbers that are infinitely large. This project required a good understanding of Java’s GUI implementations and Model–view–controller design pattern.
