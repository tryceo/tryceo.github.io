####Past Broadcast

During my free time, I created an Android application called Past Broadcast. This application can view the past videos of channels on the popular streaming platforms. Twitch.tv and Azubu.tv. The app makes calls to an external API, parses the return JSON, and displays results in a ListView format. To develop this application, I had to thoroughly learn about the Java programming language and the Android SDK.


####Flappy Java

Whenever I play video games, I've always wondered about what goes on behind the scenes. What methods are called when my character attacks? What variables does an NPC contain? Flappy Java is my first venture into video game development. It is a remake of the popular game Flappy Bird. The game was developed with object-oriented and modular programming in mind. I used a game-development application framework called [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), which allows the game to be playable on multiple platforms without rewriting code.


####Natural Number Calculator

I worked on many projects in my "Softwares I" course. One of the most challenging projects was the implementation of a GUI calculator. This calculator can do elementary arithmetic operations, such as plus and minus, as well as advanced arithmetic operations, like power and root. The calculator can handle natural numbers that are infinitely large. This project required a good understanding of the Java Swing toolkit and Model-View-Controller design pattern.
