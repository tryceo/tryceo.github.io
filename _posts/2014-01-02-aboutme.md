My name is Jack Li and I am a student at The Ohio State University. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer & Information Science. As an Honors student, I am a motivated individual and have taken many challenging courses. During my short time in college, I have learned important skills such as time management, verbal and written communication, and self-reliance.

In high school, I worked on several biology research projects in areas like plant pathology, genetics, and immunology. In college, I worked on computer science projects like Natural Number Calculator. In my free time, I have developed an Android application called PastBroadcast. Currently, I'm working on a remake of Flappy Bird called Flappy Java using libgdx.

I am currently pursuing an internship/co-op position in software development/engineering for the summer of 2015.
