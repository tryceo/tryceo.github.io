Throughout my high school years, I was interested in biology research. I thought biology was the best way for me to make an impact on this earth. My first contact with biology research was in the sophomore year at high school. During the summer of my junior year, I got a chance to work at a research lab on a project relating to a new type of signal transduction protein. I had to research the background information for weeks and read dozens of articles from [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) before I could fully understand what was even going on. I learned quickly, however, and worked on this project with the other lab members. The project was eventually published as a [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050557).

During this project, I heavily used [BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), a software that compares genetic sequences. I was amazed at how quickly this program could look through billions of base pairs on dozens of organisms and find the locations of a DNA sequence. I realized that genetic analysis on this level would be practically impossible without the help of computers. This realization sparked my interested in Computer Science.

I first began learning how to program at home using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). When I entered college, I pursued a Computer Science degree. During my free time, I like developing mobile applications and solve coding challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). 

My future lies in software development. One of the areas I’m especially interested in is Bioinformatics. I want to create software programs that model biological functions or analyze genetic data, programs that will help to unravel the mysteries of biology and push the boundaries of human knowledge.
